## Evolving Images or Pattern Using Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm is Used to evolve either any random or a smiley(Predefined in program "Hardcoded").

Feel free to change different parameters like mutation rate, population size etc and see how the evolution gets affected.

To Evolve a random pattern, uncomment line 217, and comment 218, and for evolving Smiley image, comment 217 and uncomment line 218!

You can see the demo of the Evolution of Smiley below:
